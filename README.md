# LOaBIS
Local Operations and Basic Intelligence System  
(or affectionately, Loa)

# About
Loabis started as a simple program back in 2015, whose only purpose was to restore itself from a backup if it had been tampered with.  
Somehow, this idea evolved into creating a Virtual Personal Assistant in pure python, mostly due to the lack of examples found online.  
Originally intended as a small-scale project to be run on my rasp-pi, It soon grew into the idea of cross-platform distribution, and user modification.  
And hence it's ease of modding arose, now considered to be its core feature.
