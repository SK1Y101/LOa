# LOaBIS
Local Operations and Basic Intelligence System  
(or affectionately, Loa)  

# About
Loabis started as a simple program back in 2015, whose only purpose was to restore itself from a backup if it had been tampered with.  
This idea slowly evolved into creating a Virtual Personal Assistant in pure python, adding file opening, then google searching until loabis was conceptualised how you see it being developed today.  

Originally intended as a small-scale project to be run on my rasp-pi, It soon grew into the idea of cross-platform distribution, with user modification.  
Hence it's ease of modding arose, now considered to be its core feature, and development shifted focus into building a modular framework, rather than building features into the code.  
Recent ideas, however, have returned to a simpler time, with the concept to build barebones builtin features, while allowing those to be as easily overwritten or modified as possible, so as to preserve its modding capacity.  

The name LOaBIS actually originiates as a backronym, inspired by portals "GLaDOS", with The "Basic inteligence system" being the first conceptualisation, and various itterations, until eventually "Local opperations" was settled upon.
